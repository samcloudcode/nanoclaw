# Knee Health: Programming Essentials

Actionable principles for workout design and exercise selection when programming for knee health.

## Core Principle: Full ROM Builds Resilience

**Key Insight**: Knees-over-toes and deep flexion BUILD knee strength when loaded progressively.

**Programming Implications**:
- Don't restrict knee travel—it shifts stress to hips/spine and weakens the knee
- Progressive loading through full ROM builds structural tolerance
- Start where athlete is, gradually expand range under control
- Full ROM squat variations > partial ROM for long-term knee health

## Essential Muscle Groups for Knee Protection

### Quadriceps: Eccentric Strength Matters Most

**Programming Priority**:
- Full ROM quad exercises with eccentric emphasis (deep squats, split squats, step-ups, slow step-downs)
- Terminal knee extensions for VMO activation
- **Why**: Weak eccentric quad strength = bone absorbs impact instead of muscle

**Common Pattern**: Strong concentric (cycling, leg press) but weak eccentric → knee pain. Solution: Add eccentric-focused work.

---

### Hamstrings & Glutes: ACL Protection

**Programming Priority**:
- Eccentric hamstring work (Nordic curls, RDLs, single-leg RDLs)
- Lateral hip work for glute medius (band walks, side planks, Copenhagen planks)
- **Why**: Hamstrings protect ACL during deceleration; glute med prevents knee valgus

**Key Training Effect**: Nordic curls reduce ACL/hamstring injuries 50%+ when progressed properly (see Nordic section below).

---

### Tibialis Anterior: The Forgotten Protector

**Programming Priority**:
- Tibialis raises (toe raises against wall) 3×15 daily
- Bent-knee calf raises for soleus
- **Why**: Controls foot deceleration → reduces shock transmission to knee

**Common Pattern**: Patellar tendinopathy resistant to quad work → add tibialis raises → pain drops significantly within 2 weeks.

---

## Hip Mobility Prerequisites

**Critical Rule**: Earn hip mobility BEFORE loading deep flexion + rotation.

**Programming Checkpoint**:
- Test 90/90 sit with upright torso
- Can't do it comfortably? → Work hip mobility before loading deep squats or rotational movements
- **Why**: Tight hips force knee to compensate with rotation it can't handle → meniscus stress

**Solution**: 90/90 stretches, pigeon pose 2 min/side daily for 4+ weeks before advancing loaded deep flexion.

## Knee Rehab Programming Strategy

**Core Principle**: Frequency + ROM > Intensity

**Optimal Rehab Variables**:
- **Frequency**: 4-5×/week (frequent low-stress stimulus)
- **Volume**: 8-12 sets/week per muscle group
- **Intensity**: RPE 6-7 (tissue conditioning over strength expression)
- **Progression**: ROM first, then load

**Why**: Tendons adapt 3-4× slower than muscle. Frequent moderate stress > infrequent heavy stress for joint health.

**Example**: 3×8 split squats 5×/week > 5×5 back squats 2×/week (same weekly volume, better distribution).

**ROM Progression Template**:
Box squat parallel @ 225lb → lower box 1" every 2-3 weeks @ 185lb → reach below parallel → return to 225lb = stronger + more resilient

## Exercise Selection for Knee Pain

**If Bilateral Squat Hurts → Diagnose & Modify**

**Pain Location**:
- **Bottom of squat**: Deep flexion issue → Box squat (control depth) or heels-elevated goblet squat
- **Throughout movement**: Compression issue → Unilateral work (split squat, step-up)

**Progression Path Example**:
Back squat hurts → Box squat to parallel (pain-free) → build to 4×8 RPE 7 → lower box 1" → repeat → full depth achieved

**Why Unilateral Works**:
- Half the axial load per rep (100lb split squat = 200lb back squat total load)
- Easier to maintain mechanics
- Reveals/fixes asymmetries
- **Rule**: Master unilateral positions before earning bilateral loading

---

## Nordic Curl Progression (Non-Negotiable)

**Why Nordics Are Unique**: Pure eccentric hamstring work in stretched position = matches injury mechanism.

**Critical Progression Rules**:
1. **Band regression levels**: -3 (heavy assist) → -2 → -1 → BW → +weight
2. **Stay at each level 3-4 weeks MINIMUM** (tendon adaptation lags muscle by 3-4 weeks)
3. **Target**: 3×8 with 5-sec eccentric before advancing
4. **Why 5-sec eccentric**: Time under tension for tendon adaptation, not just muscle

**Common Mistake**: Advancing too fast because it "feels easy" → muscle handles it, tendon can't → strain.

**Evidence**: 50-70% injury reduction when progressed properly. Zero benefit when rushed.

## Effective Cueing for Knee Alignment

**Principle**: External cues > Internal cues (environment focus > body part focus)

**Best Cues for Common Issues**:
- **Knee valgus (cave)**: "Spread the floor" >> "Activate glute medius"
- **Poor hip engagement**: "Screw feet into ground" >> "Externally rotate hips"
- **Weak drive**: "Push floor away" >> "Extend knees and hips"

**Why**: Environmental cues engage motor patterns naturally. Anatomical cues create overthinking.

---

## Volume Guidelines for Knee Health

**Weekly Set Benchmarks** (per muscle group):
- **Maintenance**: Quads 8-10, Hamstrings 6-8
- **Growth**: Quads 12-16, hamstrings 10-14
- **Upper limit**: Quads 20+, Hamstrings 18+

**For Knee Issues**:
- Use maintenance volume (8-10 sets quads, 6-8 hamstrings)
- Increase frequency: 12 sets as 4×3 sessions > 2×6 sessions
- Lower intensity: RPE 6-7 for tissue conditioning

**Why**: Frequent moderate stress > infrequent high stress for joint adaptation.

## When to Use This Knowledge

**Load when**:
- Programming lower body work with knee pain/history
- Designing exercise progressions or modifications
- User asks about knee-related exercise selection
- Building rehab protocols

**Remember**: This provides general principles. Always check user's MCP `knowledge` entries for their specific pain patterns, responses, and what has/hasn't worked.
